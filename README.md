![MyPDFs15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98756989/180048971-fbe19b4e-84d0-4f75-9326-d99d437fe020.png)
## Program developed by Giacomo-De-Florio-Dev
This program will allow you to protect your PDF files with a password.
Every time someone tries to access the protected file, they will have to enter the password you set.

## What the program DOES and what it DOES NOT do.
- Sets a password to a copy, created when proceeding with security, of the PDF file
- Allows you to choose the PDF file and its destination through explorer (via tkinter.filedialog)
- All procedures are carried out through a fresh, elegant and clear graphical interface.
- Before proceeding with the protection of your PDF file, you will need to repeat the password 2 times.
- DOES NOT: Encrypt the PDF file directly.
- NOT: Use proprietary libraries to handle PDF. *
- DOES NOT: Remove the password from the protected file in any way. **

---
 \* : The program uses PyPDF2 to handle PDF files. The library is set up in the program, so no additional installation is required.
 
 \** : Just for the moment. I'm working on adding this feature.

## System requirements
- It is necessary to have Python 3 (Or Later) installed on the device.
- **Available only for MicrosoftÂ® Windows (For the moment).**
